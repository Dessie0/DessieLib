### :iphone: Features

DessieLib provides two main features that are cumbersome in CraftBukkit and Spigot, but easily contained within DessieLib.

- [`InventoryAPI`]() is a powerful way to manage inventories without having to mess with events
- [`ScoreboardAPI`]() used to create organized tablists & scoreboards without the hassle of dealing with teams.

<summary>Basic InventoryAPI Usage</summary>

```java
public class me.dessie.dessielib.Main extends JavaPlugin implements CommandExecutor {

    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        InventoryAPI.register(this);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onCommand(CommandSender sender, Command command, String label, String[] args) {
        if (command.getName().equalsIgnoreCase("testinventory")) {
            //Creates an ItemBuilder as 1 Diamond, named {AQUA} Diamond. 
            ItemBuilder item = new ItemBuilder(ItemBuilder.buildItem(Material.DIAMOND, 1, "&bDiamond"));
            //Does not allow the item to be picked up
            item.cancel();
            //When we click, the item will turn into this Emerald. Then back into the Diamond when we click again.
            item.cyclesWith(ItemBuilder.buildItem(Material.EMERALD, 1, "&aEmerald"));

            //When we click the item, we'll tell the player which item they clicked.
            item.onClick(((player, itemBuilder) -> {
                player.sendMessage("Clicked " + itemBuilder.getName() + "!");

            //Create the InventoryBuilder as a size of 9 and named "Test Inventory"

            //Set the diamond item stack in slot 4
            inventoryBuilder.setItem(item, 4);

            //Tell the player they opened the inventory
            inventoryBuilder.onOpen((player, builder) -> {

DessieLib also features small API elements such as
- [`ConfigManager`](), which is used for basic external configuration loading
- [`Base64`](), which can read and write Base64 strings into `ItemStack`s or `List<ItemStack>`
